# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose 
	
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application "UNDECIDED" and creates an overview about this project including its vision, detailed information about the planned features as well as functions and boundary conditions of the development process.	
		
## 1.2 Scope 
	
UNDECIDED will be realised as a webapp and its actors will be private users, business users or administrators. 

Actors:

 - Guest:
 A Guest is a someone who has no account registered on our site.
 
 - (Business) user: 
 A (business) user is someone who has an account registered on our site. Depending on whether you are a regular or business user you have access to different functionalities of the site as shown in the [Use Case Diagram](#22-product-functionalities--features).
 
 - Administration:
 An Admin is someone from our team and can administrate the webapp.

Subsystems:

  - Authentication:  
In our authentification process a guest can register to become a user. During the registration process a guest is able to choose whether they are a normal or business user. After that a user can login to get access to the website. A user can also logout or delete their account. If a user forgets their password they can reset it.  

  - Ratings:  
A user can create and post ratings. These ratings can be edited or deleted by the user or upvoted and commented on by other users. Those comments can again be edited by the user who posted the comment. When creating a rating a user tag their friends in it.

  - Profile:  
A distinction is made between a user profile and a business user profile. A normal user can add and edit their profile data including a profile picture. Further it is possible to view the own ratings that were made. A profile also has a list of friends which were added. In contrast to a user a business user can only add profile data and edit it.

  - Business Functions:  
As a business user they have access to business-only functions. They can insert their own products with product pictures and also delete them. They can use tags for their product like 'vegan' or 'glutenfree'. After they insert the product they can also change it. They can request verification so the users know that they are the original restaurant/shop.

  - Admin Panel:  
An admin can use their admin panel to block (business) users and administrate the website meaning they are able to delete ratings or comments.

# 2. Overall Description	

## 2.1 Product Perspective 
	
The goal of our project UNDECIDED is to build a webapp solution that allows people to rate food and drinks they have consumed in a restaurant or have bought in the supermarket in order to help others decide what to order or buy. With that the users will be able to help each other deciding and to make better decisions themselves. 

>For further information on our vision see our [first blogpost](https://uundecided.wordpress.com/2021/10/10/thebeginning/).
	 
## 2.2 Product Functionalities / Features 
	
![UCD](./UseCaseDiagram.svg)
- Green: Planned till end of December
- Blue: Planned till end of June
		
## 2.3 User Characteristics 

Generally there are two types of users for UNDECIDED. People all over the world that are searching for a way to improve their decisions concerining food and drinks and businesses that would like to insert pictures of their products. Further than that there are no restrictions to the target groups but it is realistic that the younger generation will most probably use the application more than older generations that might not be as familiar with modern technology.
	
## 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies 
	
- Backend: Spring Boot Framework
- Frontend: Angular
- Database: Maria DB
- IDE: IntelliJ
- Version Control: Git
- Repository Platform: GitHub
- CI/CD: Docker & Jenkins 
- Mockups: Zeplin & Figma 
- Scrum-Platform: JIRA

## 3.2 Usability
	
We will build the user interface intuitive, so that a new user does not necessarily need an explanation. If questions arise our interface provides a comprehensive FAQ. If the user doesn't know the principle of flashcards and a system to learn with them, the user interface provides a manual how to learn with flashcards as well.
	
## 3.3 Reliability
tbd
### 3.3.1 Availability
### 3.3.2 Defect Rate
### 3.3.3 MTBF, MTTR
### 3.3.3 Accuracy
### 3.3.4 Bug classes

## 3.4 Performance

### 3.4.1 Response time
Response times are kept low to guarantee a fluent user experience.

### 3.4.2 Throughput
tbd

### 3.4.3 Capacity
Our system should be able to handle hundreds to thousands of requests every minute. We are looking forward to increase the capacity to unlimited as the app grows in popularity.

### 3.4.4 Resource utilization
Due to the project being a webapp, we cannot utilize the storage of the user's devices effectively. Because every rating can include an image, we will need a lot of storage space.

## 3.5 Supportability
The front- and backend are seperated into two different repositories, but the frontend repository is treated as a submodule of the backend repository.

The code will be written according to naming standards/convetions and as self-explanatory code, so reading and actually understanding what your team mates did will be easier.

CODING STANDARDS <br/>
TESTING STRATEGY <br/>
tbd

## 3.6 Design Constraints
We are focused on building a modern-looking web-application using modern technologies. Of course there are other smaller libraries and frameworks used than the ones that are listed, but they represent just a small fraction of the whole project and aren't worth mentioning. In order to meet the requirements and wished of our team we conducted a survey which shows the [linked result](./word_cloud.png).

## 3.7 Online User Documentation & Help System Requirements
	
The user interface will be intuitive and simple so that the user can navigate easily between the different sections. Futhermore it is planned that there will be a FAQ and a help page, where the basic steps for using the webapp will be presented and explained step-by-step.
