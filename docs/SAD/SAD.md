# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview
of the system, using a number of different architectural views
to depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture
and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made
on the system.

## 1.2 Scope
This document describes the technical architecture of the UNDECIDED project, including the structure of classes, modules and dependencies.

## 1.5 Overview
This document contains the Architectural Representation, Goals and Constraints as well
as the Logical, Deployment, Implementation and Data Views.

# 2. Architectural Representation
We are trying to implement according to the MVC pattern:  
![MVC](MVC.png)

In our project it looks like the following picture:  
![MVC structure](SAD-Overview.svg)

# 3. Architectural Goals and Constraints
As already mentioned our project follows the MVC architecure. By following the guidelines of this architecture we are able to generate clean code.

## Frontend
The frontend is written in Typescript, HTML and CSS and we are using the Angular framework. By the seperation of components from the
rest of the code Angular allows us to stick to the MVVM pattern.

- Model: domain specific classes modeled after backend classes
- View: components
- ViewModel: functionalities of components

## Backend
The backend is written in Java and as a MVC tool we are using Spring Boot.
For accounting we are using Spring Security. The backend offers a REST
API (Open API) which are accesed by our frontend.

- Model: domain specific classes
- View: no view available
- Controller: REST-Controller

# 4. Use-Case View
Our overall UC diagram:

# 5. Logical View

## 5.1 Overview
The following image shows a UML diagram of our project whose elements are categorized by model, view and controller.

### Model
#### Frontend
![models-angular](modelsAngular.svg)
#### Backend
![models-spring](backend-models.svg)

### Controller
#### Frontend
Due the controller view being very complex we decided to only show the following frontend controllers:

![controller-angular](controllerAngular.svg)

#### Backend
![controller-spring](backend-controllers.svg)

### View
#### Frontend
Because in Angular controller and view is not strictly seperated it's the same diagram as in the controller section.
